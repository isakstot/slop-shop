# Slop Shop Webshop
#### An Express.js based Web application made for a school project

## Information:
This was a group project, but I made all of the backend logic and the docker setup (most of the frontend too, just not the home page or the products inserted into the database).

**Slop Shop is a slightly modified version of the original project (Student Swap):**
