# Slop Shop Webshop
#### An Express.js based Web Application made for a school project

## Information:
This is a web shop made for the course Web Programming that I took at Reutlingen University. The instructions were very specific about certain things, so if something is weird that is why.

It was a group project, but I made all of the backend logic and the docker setup (most of the frontend too, just not the home page or the products inserted into the database).

**Slop Shop is a slightly modified version of the original project (Student Swap):**
